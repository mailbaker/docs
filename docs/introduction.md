# What is MailBaker?

MailBaker is a framework for developing HTML emails.

It's powered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and comes with features such as components, expressions, and various automations that make coding HTML emails easier.

MailBaker relies on custom tags that expand into predefined, table-based HTML markup. Although it offers abstractions for components and templating tags, using them is essential for creating visually appealing email templates.

This gives you complete control over your email code, ensuring you aren't restricted by the framework's core for component markup, styling, or accessibility.
